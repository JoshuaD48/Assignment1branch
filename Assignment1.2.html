            <h3>A little more about myself</h3>
            
            <p>

                To go in depth about myself. I enjoy playing video games, 
                playing basketball,a liitle bit of video filming with my friends and listening to music.<br>
                I have 2 brothers and a pet dog. My  dream when i grow up is to makes video games as good as they once
                were. In todays day, the devolpers <br> have gotten very lazy when it comes to making something sustainable
                that the community will love. I feel like I will do my best to listen to what people <br> have to say to make
                to make the game better. becaus at the end of the day, the consumers are the ones playing the game. 
                not the developers
            </p>
